## Scenerio 2 

Imagine a server with the following specs:
● 4 times Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4830 v4 @ 2.00GHz
● 64GB of ram
● 2 TB HDD disk space
● 2 x 10Gbit/s nics
The server is used for SSL offloading and proxies around 25000 requests per
second. Please let us know which metrics are interesting to monitor in that specific
case and how would you do that? What are the challenges of monitoring this?


## Solution:
  - Proxies around 25000 requests per second means that the server acts as a proxy servr for incoming requests, forwarding them to the backend application servers.
  - SSL offloading means that the server is responsible for handling SSL/TLS encryption and decryption for incoming requests. 
  - This allows the actual application servers behind the load balancer to focus on serving content rather than spending CPU cycles on encryption and decryption.

  ## Now, let's discuss the steps to monitor this server and the challenges involved:

  - Identify the relevant metrics to monitor: In this case, some of the relevant metrics to monitor could include CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk I/O, network I/O, SSL/TLS handshake time, number of incoming requests per second, number of connections established, number of connections dropped, etc.

  - Choose the appropriate monitoring tools: There are several monitoring tools available in the market such as Zabbix, Nagios, Prometheus, Grafana, etc. Based on the budget and requirements, one can choose the most appropriate tool.

  - Set up monitoring agents: The monitoring tool needs to be installed on the server, and monitoring agents need to be set up for each metric that needs to be monitored.

  - Configure alerts: Based on the criticality of the metrics being monitored, appropriate alerts need to be set up. For example, if CPU utilization crosses a certain threshold, an alert should be sent to the team responsible for maintaining the server.

  - Analyze the data: Once monitoring is set up, data will start flowing in, and it needs to be analyzed to identify trends and patterns. This will help in identifying potential issues and taking corrective action before it becomes a problem.

  ## Some of the challenges involved in monitoring this server could include:
  - High volume of incoming requests: With 25,000 requests per second, there is a lot of data to process, which could potentially overwhelm the monitoring tools.

  - Large number of metrics: With multiple CPUs, high RAM, and high network bandwidth, there are several metrics to monitor, which could be difficult to manage.

  - Handling SSL/TLS offloading: Since the server is responsible for SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, it is important to monitor the SSL/TLS handshake time to ensure that it does not become a bottleneck.

  - Dealing with false positives: With so many metrics to monitor, it is important to set up alerts carefully to avoid false positives, which could lead to alert fatigue.

  ## To mitigate these challenges
  - it is important to carefully select the monitoring tools and set up appropriate alerts and thresholds. 

  - It is also important to regularly review the metrics being monitored and adjust the alerts and thresholds as needed.

  - Capacity planning: While monitoring the server, it is important to keep an eye on the resource utilization trends to predict future growth and plan for additional capacity accordingly.

  - Load testing: It is a good practice to periodically perform load testing on the server to ensure that it can handle the expected workload and identify any potential bottlenecks.

  - Logging and log analysis: It is important to configure logging on the server and analyze the logs to identify potential issues and troubleshoot them quickly.

  - Security monitoring: Since the server is responsible for SSL offloading, it is important to monitor for any security threats and vulnerabilities that could affect the server.

  - Regular maintenance: Regular maintenance tasks such as patching, updates, and backups should be performed to ensure the server is running smoothly and can handle unexpected failures or disasters.
